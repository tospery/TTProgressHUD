# TTProgressHUD

`TTProgressHUD` is a light weight HUD written in SwiftUI meant to display the progress of an ongoing task on iOS. `TTProgressHUD` (left) was designed to look as similar as possible to the Apple HUD (example from Podcast.app, right).

## Installation

Xcode 11 and iOS 13 is required.

### Swift Package Manager

* Xcode: File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency
* Paste https://github.com/honkmaster/TTProgressHUD

### Manually

Drag `TTProgressHUD.swift` and `TTProgressHUDConfig.swift` into your project.

## Usage

**Use `TTProgressHUD` wisely! Only use it if you absolutely need to perform a task before taking the user forward. Bad use case examples: pull to refresh, infinite scrolling, sending message.**

### Import

Import the `TTProgressHUD`  package: 

```swift
import TTProgressHUD
```

### Instantiate and show the HUD view

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var hudVisible = true
    @State var hudConfig = TTProgressHUDConfig()
    
    var body: some View {
        TTProgressHUD($hudVisible, config: hudConfig)
    }
}
```

## Customization

`TTProgressHUD` can be customized via the `TTProgressHUDConfig` struct.
The default values were chosen so that `TTProgressHUD` looks as similar as possible to the Apple HUD.

```swift
public init(
    type:TTProgressHUDType         = .loading,
    title:String?                  = nil,
    caption:String?                = nil,
    minSize:CGSize                 = CGSize(width: 100.0, height: 100.0),
    cornerRadius:CGFloat           = 12.0,
    backgroundColor:Color          = .clear,
    titleForegroundColor:Color     = .primary,
    captionForegroundColor:Color   = .secondary,
    shadowColor:Color              = .clear,
    shadowRadius:CGFloat           = 0.0,
    borderColor:Color              = .clear,
    borderWidth:CGFloat            = 0.0,
    lineWidth:CGFloat              = 10.0,
    imageViewSize:CGSize           = CGSize(width: 100, height: 100),
    imageViewForegroundColor:Color = .primary,        
    successImage:String            = "checkmark.circle",
    warningImage:String            = "exclamationmark.circle",
    errorImage:String              = "xmark.circle",
    shouldAutoHide:Bool            = false,
    allowTapToHide:Bool            = false,
    autoHideInterval: TimeInterval = 10.0,
    hapticsEnabled:Bool            = true
){...}
```

## Haptic Feedback

`TTProgressHUD` will automatically trigger haptic feedback depending on which HUD is being displayed. The feedback maps as follows:

* `TTProgressHUDType.success` <-> `UINotificationFeedbackTypeSuccess`
* `TTProgressHUDType.warning` <-> `UINotificationFeedbackTypeWarning`
* `TTProgressHUDType.error` <-> `UINotificationFeedbackTypeError`
